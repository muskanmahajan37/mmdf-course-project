# mmdf-course-project
In this project, real multi-modal data is studied by utilizing different techniques presented during the course. In addition, there is an optional task to try some different approaches to identify persons from the same dataset. Open MEx dataset from UCI machine learning repository is used. 
Idea is to apply different techniques to recognize physical exercises from wearable sensors and depth camera, user-independently.
